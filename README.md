%% 2024 OPhO P34 Numerical Analysis %%
% This code aims to solve problem 34 on the 2024 OPhO through numerical
% analysis. The base concept is building a grid of nodes and updating their
% voltages through the checkerboard method. Then, one can sum up individual
% voltage differences across the board and divide that by the individual
% resistances to find the current.
